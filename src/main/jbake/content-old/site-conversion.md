The Sling website was recently converted to use the Apache CMS for content management,
and we still have to check a number of pages for correct conversion.

During this transition phase, old versions of a number of pages are still present under
/site, along with their converted versions at other, more specific paths.

To find the new pages, you can use the site navigation or search the Web for phrases that
are present in the old pages, and select results that do not contain /site/ in their URLs.

If you see new pages that look good and match the contents of the corresponding old pages,
feel free to let us know, via the Sling users mailing list or the
[SLING-2002](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-2002) issue.
